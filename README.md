# APT Simulation Framework (APT-SF)

**APT Simulation Framework (APT-SF)** is a comprehensive framework designed to enable Red Team professionals to simulate Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks and conduct APT hunting exercises. By leveraging frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK, TIBER-EU, the Diamond Model, and the Unified Kill Chain, this tool aims to deliver realistic emulation plans that help improve organizational security postures.

---

## Objectives

- Simulate real-world APT campaigns using structured methodologies.
- Map TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) to MITRE ATT&CK.
- Incorporate threat intelligence via the Diamond Model.
- Facilitate adversary emulation and defense validation using the Unified Kill Chain.
- Provide tools and guidance for attack surface management (ASM) and custom TTP development.

## Features

### 1. **APT Emulation**
   - **Adversary Emulation Plans**: Simulate APT groups using MITRE ATT&CK and other resources.
   - **Phases Based on Kill Chains**: Incorporate Cyber Kill Chain and Unified Kill Chain methodologies.
   - **Customizable Scenarios**: Adapt plans for specific APT groups like APT3 and FIN6.

### 2. **Threat Intelligence Integration**
   - **Diamond Model**: Enhance intelligence gathering and analysis.
   - **Threat Intel Feeds**: Integrate resources like [APT Campaigns](https://github.com/CyberMonitor/APT_CyberCriminal_Campagin_Collections).

### 3. **Attack Surface Management**
   - **Discovery**: Identify and prioritize targets.
   - **ASM Tools**: Automate reconnaissance using tools like Intelx, Censys and Shodan.

### 4. **Custom TTPs**
   - Build, customize, and deploy TTPs to match organizational needs.
   - Use frameworks like Atomic Red Team for granular testing.

## Framework Components

### APT Simulation Modules
- **Reconnaissance**: Passive and active scanning techniques.
- **Resource Development**: Use simulated infrastructure for payload delivery.
- **Exploitation**: Employ techniques such as phishing and malware deployment.

### Threat Intel Integration
- **Diamond Model**: Define adversary, victim, infrastructure, and capability nodes.
- **Feeds**: Import intel from [threat repositories](https://github.com/hslatman/awesome-threat-intelligence).

### Adversary Simulation Tools
- **Atomic Red Team**: Simplify TTP emulation.
- **APTSimulator**: Execute predefined scenarios for testing defenses.


### **Results**
Results are stored in the `output/` directory and include:
- Attack paths
- Defensive gaps
- Recommendations

## Methodology

### Cyber Kill Chain
Each phase aligns with specific attack vectors:
1. **Reconnaissance**
2. **Weaponization**
3. **Delivery**
4. **Exploitation**
5. **Installation**
6. **Command & Control**
7. **Actions on Objectives**

### Unified Kill Chain
Expands traditional kill chains to include persistence, lateral movement, and more.

### MITRE ATT&CK
TTPs are mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework to ensure consistency and clarity.

---

## Example: APT3 Simulation

1. **Reconnaissance**: Gather open-source intelligence (OSINT) on targets.
2. **Delivery**: Utilize spear-phishing techniques (T1566).
3. **Exploitation**: Execute malicious payloads using CVE-2017-11882.
4. **Command & Control**: Establish communication using DNS tunneling (T1071.004).
5. **Actions on Objectives**: Extract sensitive data (T1020).
